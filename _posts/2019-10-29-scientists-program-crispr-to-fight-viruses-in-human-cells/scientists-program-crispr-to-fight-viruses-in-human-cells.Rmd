| General topic                | Developpement of a DNA sequences that will be able to target a precises virus and destroy it       |
| Procedure/what was examined  | They tried the CRISPR on 3 diff√©rent viruses, they tried it with Cas13 instead of Cas9 which had already been analysed in other study |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They didn't find a way to target one virus and didn't try yet on animals, but they had proved that's really effective on several virus       |
| Remaining questions?         | How to make it work on human, and make it aiming a specify virus ? |
